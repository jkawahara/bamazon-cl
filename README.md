# bamazon-cl
# Getting Started - Bamazon Command-Line
### 1. Why / Background
  * This is Berkeley Coding Boot Camp (BCBC) week 6 homework assignment.
    * The BCBC curriculum generally focuses on JavaScript along with HTML/CSS, using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) software stack, to teach web development skills across the client and server. 
  * The Bamazon is a command-line node application:
    * Takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory
    * Provides manager and supervisor views for maintaining inventory
    * (Bonus) This app also tracks product sales across store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store
 ### 2. What / Objectives / User Stories
  * This project development, from design through deployment of the application, used Node.js and MySQL as the primary web development technology on the server side along with npm:
    * The following npm packages were used:
      * inquirer: collection of common interactive command-line user interfaces
      * mysql: node.js driver for mysql
      * console.table: prints an array of objects as a table in console
  * User Stories, by categorization:
    * Bamazon DB Schema defining products and departments tables
    * Main Controller to establish connection to database
    * Customer viewing and ordering products
    * Manager viewing products, low inventory and adding products, inventory
    * Supervisor viewing product sales and creating departments
 ### 3. How / Design Description
  * The scope of the project fit well into [Agile methodology with Scrum and Kanban frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). Due to limited scope and non-group assignment, GitHub's built-in tools were not used to support project execution:
    * [Projects](https://github.com/jkawahara/bamazon-cl/projects) Kanban board for documenting user stories and overall progress
    * [Issues](https://github.com/jkawahara/bamazon-cl/issues) Issue tracking for user stories, features and bug report
  * Functionality - refer to [video of application user flow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YlMjCQ4RwPSYQIhm3CAlS3O_GO9Vaxxz):
    * Design Description
      * Bamazon DB Schema defines the following tables with fields:
        * products table
          * item_id (primary key), product_name, department_name, price, stock_quantity, product_sales
        * departments table
          * department_id (primary key), department_name, over_head_costs
      * General design of views
        * Require modules and packages: mysql, inquirer, console.table
        * Establish connection to MySQL bamazon database
        * Relevant functions: mysql.createConnection(), connection.connect()
      * Customer View 
      * View Products Listing: Display item_id, product_name, price by performing read operation using SELECT SQL query of products table
        * Prompt customer for item_id and number of units to order
          * If insufficient inventory, log and end order
          * If sufficient inventory, reduce stock_quantity, log cost, update product_sales by performing update operation using UPDATE SQL query of products table
        * Relevant functions: viewCustomer(), promptCustomerMsg1(), promptCustomerMsg2(), checkInventory(), reduceInventory(), updateSales()
        * Relevant modules: bamazonCustomer.js
      * Manager View
        * Display menu of options for manager:
          * View Products for Sale: Display item_id, product_name, price, stock_quantity for all item_ids by performing read operation using SELECT SQL query of products table
          * View Low Inventory: Display item_id, product_name, price, stock_quantity for stock_quantity less than 5 by performing read operation using SELECT SQL query of products table
          * Add to Inventory: Add stock_quantity for any existing item_id by performing update operation using UPDATE SQL query of products table
          * Add New Product: Add new item_id by performing create operation using INSERT SQL query of products table
        * Relevant functions: viewManager(), displayProducts(), displayLowInventory(), addInventory(), addNewProduct()
        * Relevant modules: bamazonManager.js
      * Supervisor View
        * Display menu of options for supervisor:
          * View Product Sales by Department: Display department_id, department_name, over_head_costs, product_sales, total_profit by performing read operation using SELECT SQL query of departments and products tables, including SUM, AS, JOIN, GROUP BY syntax
          * Create New Department: Create new department_id by performing create operation using INSERT SQL query of departments table
        * Relevant functions: viewSupervisor(), displayProductsByDept(), createNewDept()
        * Relevant modules: bamazonSupervisor.js
   * Prerequisites for Development:
    * MacBook Air (Intel Core i7, 2.2 GHz, 1 Processor, 2 Cores, 8GB)
    * 64 bit operating system 
    * git version 2.18.0

    * [GitHub bamazon-cl](https://github.com/jkawahara/bamazon-cl)
    * Chrome Version 70.0.3538.110 (Official Build) (64-bit)
   * Built With:
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/documentation.html)

   * Installing:
    * For further development or use of this application, clone or download application files from GitHub, which is organized into the following directory structure:
      * /bamazon-cl (application root directory level)
        * /node_modules (ignored by git) - generated first time npm install executes
        * .gitignore
        * bamazon.sql
        * bamazonCustomer.js
        * bamazonManager.js
        * bamazonSupervisor.js
        * LICENSE
        * package-lock.json - generated each time npm install executes
        * package.json - includes dependencies: inquirer
        * README.md
    * Once the application files are ready per the above structure, go to the application root directory level
      * Enter the following in terminal to execute SQL script file bamazon_schema.sql to create/use database and create/seed/SELECT tables
        * mysql -u 'root' -p
        * source bamazon_schema.sql
      * Enter the following in termminal to install required node packages. This executes by referring to the included dependencies in package.json and creates required node packages in /node_modules and package-lock.json:
        * npm install
   * Running the tests:
    * Unit testing & integration testing was informally executed
   * Deployment:
    * N/A as this is a command-line application
